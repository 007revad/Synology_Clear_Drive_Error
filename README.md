# Synology clear drive error
Clear drive critical errors so DSM will let you use the drive

If a drive gets kicked out of RAID DSM stores "status critical" in a database and will not let you use the drive again. If you test the drive in a computer and find there is nothing wrong with the drive you can use this script on the Synology to delete that drive's "status critical" entries from DSM's database.
